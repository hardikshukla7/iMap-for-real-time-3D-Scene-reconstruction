 Through this project, my objective is to demonstrate the viability of utilizing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the
 underlying scene representation for a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Our project incorporates the keyframe
 structure, examines the comparison between positional encoding and Gaussian encoding, and sheds light on the implementation of the
 algorithm on an F-1/10th car for localization purposes. We operate under the assumption of lacking prior data, with the MLP constructing
 a dense map dynamically as images become accessible to it
